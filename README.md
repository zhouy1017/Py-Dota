# Py-Dota
This project aims to calculate Fantasy Scores for all completed DPC tournaments to provide insights for choosing rosters for upcoming matches.

The calculation formula is based on DPC app by Valve.

This project pulls information from website of DotaBuff(https://www.dotabuff.com/) 
and uses API from OpenDota(https://www.opendota.com/) as source of data.  
And manually take tournaments information from Liquipedia(https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Main_Page).

# TODO
After finishing basic functions, plan to build a github page to directly provide updated calculated results.
